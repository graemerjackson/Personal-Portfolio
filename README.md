# GraemeRJackson-Personal-Portfolio
The concept of this portolio is to showcase some, but not all, of my current programming capabilities. The portfolio will be split into a range of seperate projects which will all store their respective datasets, development code, and any visualisations/outputted files from their runs.
The portfolio will support my applications to Data Science related positions in the near future.
