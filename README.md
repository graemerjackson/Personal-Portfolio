# Personal-Portfolio
This portfolio incorporates a variety of personal projects undertaken throughout my MSc. at UCL and into my first year as a data specialist within FS.
Each project showcases my capabilites in exploring such a subject, and illustrates at a high level my area of expertise when developing the code and analytics required to tackle the variety of problems at hand.
The portfolio shall support any future Data Scientist applications.
